      You are in a small room with a flickering, fluorescent light. The walls are painted a sickly green, and the floor is covered in a dirty, threadbare carpet.

      On the East wall, there is a rosette window from an old church. It depicts a saint with a halo, holding a key.

      On the North wall, there is a door.
